# TODO

- per-name json files for informations (multi paragraph description, links etc)
  - info is provided as variable (same way as config)
  - info could contain the full name (displayed in the lower area, used for meta tags)
  - implement info as sidebar
- handle touch events <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events>
    -> for zoom, the main html should implement `<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no"/>`
- motion blur (shader)
- logger (with loglevel by query param)
